# Chicken shop review app

## Summary
App to post reviews of chicken shops and restaurants in London based purely on the quality of their chicken wings

## Why

During the First Lockdown, I realised my love of chicken wings - small enough to not gorge yourself on, yet still packing tonnes of flavour and satisfaction. I was doing a pizza delivery job and wanted a change from the same 2 pizzas I'd get each shift. Obviously chicken wings was the natural replacement (along with all other kinds of junk food - it was lockdown, after all), but from where? That was the main question.

In my corner of London there are an abundance of shops to choose from, but plenty are unknown quantities. I've discussed the merits of one shop over another with family, comparing shops' recipes after a change and pricing. I thought to myself that it'd be a good idea to write down our reviews for future knowledge so we'd know the next time we're hungry. Thus, the app idea was born.

## Improvements - versions to come
- For now, there's free reign for anyone to add a shop and review. Naturally, the implementation of users will come in to the app. Hopefully with OAuth log in.
- The colours are currently horrible. Some good UI design would be appreciated
